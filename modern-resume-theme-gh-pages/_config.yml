  Hi, my name's Fernando Linares and I'm a recent Full Stack Web Developer graduate from Coding Dojo. I have experience making web apps and will continue to expand my knowledge by creating everything I possibly can create with multiple programming languages. I will forever be a student of web development but at some point I will call myself an expert. Stay tuned.

  I am most skilled in: <mark>Python/Django</mark> and <mark>Eating Pizza</mark>

          ##This is probably one of the greatest apps ever created, if you don't agree you're probably wrong.

            Every Amazon facility requires a TOM team to check in/out and park all tractors and trailers. Without this team, there would essentially be no Amazon. How else would the products even reach the building, let alone the customers?

          During my time at Hartford, I learnt most of my key skills that I have taken through my career such as teamwork and working to tight deadlines. I thouroughly enjoyed my time as university and learnt a lot about a healthy work life balance.

          I spent a lot of my free time keeping myself busy with school work, actual work and the gym. A body in motion stays in motion, right? However, I always made time for my family, who've been nothing but supportive in all my endeavors both educational and personal.
